# EMER2GENT

As a response to the situation, R2 Data Labs (R2DL) is building an alliance to access diverse datasets and combine them in novel ways. Our aim is to collaborate  to determine whether there are previously unknown or unexpected correlations that can provide insight into the behaviour of the pandemic virus and how recovery from the situation can be detected and optimised.
